    # Recover from an error after editing the commit message but before completing the commit.

    # Sometimes I write a long commit message in my editor, save and quit, and then discover that
    # the commit failed for some reason. (Typically because it tried to sign the commit with my
    # private key, but it could not read my private key.)
    #
    # I don't want to lose the long commit message when that happens. Fortunately, it's still there
    # in .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG, and I can pull it back up in my editor with this alias.
