# Scripting!
#
# This is the most elaborate part of my nix config. Basically, this
# converts my scripts/ directory into a bunch of nix packages, one per
# script.
#
# It knows how to package a few different languages.
#
# Scripts can declare in a comment at the top of the file that they depend
# on other programs at runtime, and the packaging logic here will do the
# appropriate bundling to ensure they have access to those programs.
#
# Python scripts can declare their pypi dependencies in a comment at the
# top of file, too.
#
# All of this packaging works in sandbox mode, as well. This is important
# to me because my work machine is in sandbox mode and I don't want to turn
# that off.
