My scripts.

Python, shell, and rust scripts. Each one gets built into a binary of the same name as the script and installed in my profile. eg "\_jeremy-post-install.rs" is compiled to the binary "\_jeremy-post-install", and "index.sh" is copied to a file named "index" and marked executable.

Scripts named with leading underscores are ones I never invoke directly -- I either use shell wrappers for them or they are invoked by other programs.
